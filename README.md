# BouncingBall
This is a test website to host a p5js project that we recently learned in class from Professor Meng. 
My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/ajm054/sketches/5z8-Zjy1O]. 
Below is a screenshot of the program, which has randomly colored and sized balls bouncing within the window and off of the text box in the top left. 
There is also music that plays when the program is run. 

Here is the website that runs the program [].
